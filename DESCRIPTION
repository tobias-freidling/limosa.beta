Description: Optimization-based framework to conduct sensitivity analysis
    for the identification assumptions of linear regression and
    instrumental variable models.  Users provide the data and sspecify
    direct or comparative bounds on the influence of an unmeasured
    confounder on observed variables. The package estimates the resulting
    partially identified region, provides uncertainty quantification and
    visualizations of the results.
